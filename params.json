{"name":"NotifyUser","tagline":"Simple Bukkit plugin that allows players to send and receive notifications via mention and command.","body":"# NotifyUser\r\n###*A simple Bukkit chat notification plugin*\r\nVersion 1.0.x compatibable with Bukkit 1.7.10+\r\n\r\n## About\r\n\r\nNotifyUser is a quick-and-easy chat plugin for sending and receiving chat notifications. When a player \"tags\" another user in the chat area (e.g. \"@Andorem\"), the username will become highlighted and the pinged user will receive a customizable alert, from sounds already available in Minecraft.\r\n\r\n As a result of a desire for a a bit more customizable ping plugin, NotifyUser has several configuration preferences for choosing different sounds, muting notifications, tagging & pinging options.\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\n\r\nThough customizable, NotifyUser works out of the box and requires no extra set-up to use. Just drop the Jar file into your server's plugin folder, restart, and you're good to go. Or, if you so wish, tweak the default configuration file. It's up to you!\r\n\r\n## How to use\r\n\r\n### Pinging a player\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to send notifications to other users, through public chat tagging and a command.\r\n\r\nTo ping a player from the chat, simply \"tag\" them with the appropriate symbol: `Hey, @TeddyRoosevelt! What's up?`. The tagged username will become highlighted and the mentioned user will receive a sound alert. This is not case-sensitive, and it recognizes partial usernames, so `@Teddy` and `@teddyroosevelt` work just as well.\r\n\r\nIf you want to ping a player without making a public mention, you can type `/nu [username]` without any symbol in order to notify them directly. They will receive a message saying who pinged them and a sound alert (unless disabled). The same name sensitivity as the first method applies.\r\n\r\n### Muting notifications\r\n\r\nIf a player wishes to not receive sound alerts or on-command pings, they can use `/nu mute`. Text tag-highlighting will still go through, but both sound alerts and pings made through the `/nu` command will be blocked. This acts as a toggle, and can be turned off by typing `/nu mute` again.\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\n\r\nAll commands can also be executed with **/notifyuser** and **/nfy**.\r\n\r\n### General commands:\r\n\r\n* **/nu [username]** - Send a notification to a specific user without typing into public chat.\r\n* **/nu help** - Show all available NotifyUser commands.\r\n* **/nu mute** - Toggle mute/unmute for incoming notifications.\r\n\r\n### Admin commands:\r\n\r\n* **/nu set [SOUND_NAME]** - Set the notification sound to be heard by all players. (Refer to [http://jd.bukkit.org/org/bukkit/Sound.html](http://jd.bukkit.org/org/bukkit/Sound.html))\r\n* **/nu reload** - Reloads the NotifyUser configuration file.\r\n\r\n## Permissions\r\n\r\n* **NotifyUser.*** - Gives access to all NotifyUser commands.

Anything below will not  be highlighted or make a ping noise.\r\n    * notify\r\n      * True or false. If true, the player pinged by /nu [username] will be told who sent it.\r\n\r\n## Setting up\r\n\r\nThere are several optional preferences for customization within the `config.yml` if you so desire. After editing and saving the file, either restart the server or type `/nu reload` to update the plugin's settings.\r\n\r\n### The notification alert\r\n\r\n#### Changing the sound\r\n\r\nYou can change the sound a player hears when they are pinged with the `/nu set [SOUND_NAME]` command in-game, or by editing `notifications.sound-effect` in the config file.\r\n\r\nTo determine the name of the alert you want, refer to the list of sounds [here](jd.bukkit.org/org/bukkit/Sound.html). Be sure to include any underscores and correct capitalization.\r\n\r\n#### Controlling volume and pitch\r\n\r\nIf you want to set how loud or high-pitched the sound is, you can do so by editing `notifications.volume` and `notifications.pitch` in the config file, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe `volume` determines how loud or quiet the alert noise will be when mentioned or pinged. 100 corresponds to full volume.\r\n\r\nThe `pitch` determines how high or low pitched it will sound. 1 represents the noise's normal range of pitch. Feel free to experiment, but it might be best left alone.\r\n\r\n### Tweak player mentions\r\n\r\n#### The tag handle\r\n\r\nThe tag handle is the symbol that a player must type right before a username in order to activate the ping mention. If a valid username is tagged, it will become highlighted in the chat area for easy noticing, and a ping will be sent to that player (unless it is muted).\r\n\r\nBy default, the tag handle is `@`, however it can be easily changed by editing `chat.symbol` in the config. Though a single special character is reccomended, the tag handle can be any one string you wish (e.g. `>>` or `Wololo`).\r\n\r\nYou can also change the color that the tagged username will be highlighted by adding an \"&\" color code in `chat.highlight-color`.\r\n\r\n#### Choosing how pings work\r\n\r\nNotifyUser gives you the option of tweaking how a ping mention will be activated in the main chat or silent commands. You can change the minimum amount of letters of a username that a person must type in order to ping someone with `chat.min-num-length`. Anything tagged below this number will be ignored, not highlighted, and no alert made.\r\n\r\nTo determine whether or not an on-command ping will alert the recipient or not, change `chat.notify` to false. When true, the command `/nu [username]` will send both a sound alert and silent message `\"SENDER has pinged you!\" to the user.\r\n\r\n\\[[Source Code](https://github.com/Andorem/NotifyUser)\\]\r\n","google":"UA-70098500-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
